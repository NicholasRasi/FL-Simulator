#   Mobile keyboard prediction
#
#   Next-word predictions can predict the most probable next word or phrase
#   depending on a small amount of user-generated preceding text.
#
#   - highly heterogeneous dataset, since it depends on the geographic area
#   - personalization needed in order to apply a different model depending on the area
#   - presence of malicious devices, wrong prediction given by the fact that people misspell words or use abbreviations
#   - devices requirements: at least N GB of memory available, are charging, connected to unmetered network, in idle
#

adversary_num: ? # define the expected number of malicious devices

non_iid_partitions: ? # to express the hetereogenity of devices

algorithms:
  fit:
    selection: ? # to detect malicious devices and remove their local model from aggregation

simulation:
    model_name: ? # define an appropriate dataset
