#   Pedestrian detection for autonomous vehicles
#
#   Given a dataset of images, we need to detect pedestrians.
#
#   - the selected dataset is ? which is appropriate for object detection
#   - highly heterogeneous dataset, since it depends on the individual routine, habits, level of traffic
#   - robustness is fundamental: a form of intelligence that can overcome faults and failures quickly is needed,
#     thereby ensuring system resilience and service continuity
#   - The selection of devices must be performed depending on the quality of images, for example non-blurred images are preferred
